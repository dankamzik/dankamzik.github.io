Ode to the hourglass
Oh, how the hours pass
Years slip by like grains of sand
They plink, they pile and pour out of hand
So trust in me,
When I say to you
That every day is something new
Never lament not as a new day passes
For that's the beauty of hourglasses
Should your hours be colored
Crimson or Clover
Simply pick the glass up
And turn it on over
